# Voice Assistant - Python Internship Project

This project was developed as part of my Python Programming internship at Oasis Infobyte. It's a voice-controlled assistant that demonstrates practical applications of Python programming concepts and various libraries.

## About the Project

As a beginner in Python programming, I created this voice assistant to learn and implement:
- Speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion
- Working with Python libraries and APIs
- Basic command-line interface development
- Error handling and user interaction
- File I/O operations

## Features

The voice assistant can:
- Respond to basic greetings
- Tell the current time and date
- Search the web for information
- Look up information on Wikipedia
- Provide weather updates (coming soon)
- Answer general knowledge questions (coming soon)

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
- How to use the `speech_recognition` library for voice input
- Text-to-speech conversion using `pyttsx3`
- Working with datetime for time and date operations
- Web scraping and API integration basics
- Error handling and user feedback
- Project structure and documentation

## What I Learned During My Internship

This project was completed as part of my Python Programming internship at Oasis Infobyte. During this internship, I had the opportunity to:

- Apply theoretical Python concepts to a real-world project.
- Gain hands-on experience with speech recognition, text-to-speech, and integrating multiple Python libraries.
- Improve my problem-solving skills by handling errors and debugging issues.
- Learn the importance of clear documentation and code readability.
- Understand the basics of using Git and GitHub for version control and project sharing.
- Experience the process of taking a project from idea to implementation and deployment.

This internship has helped me build confidence in my programming abilities and prepared me for future projects and professional growth.

## Technical Details

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Microphone for voice input
- Speakers for voice output

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aanch17/voice-assistant.git
cd voice-assistant
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. For Windows users, you might need to install PyAudio separately:
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

### Usage

Run the assistant:
```bash
python voice_assistant.py
```

### Available Commands

- "Hello" - Greets the user
- "What time is it?" - Tells the current time
- "What's the date today?" - Tells the current date
- "Search for [query]" - Searches the web
- "Tell me about [topic]" - Searches Wikipedia
- "Exit" or "Quit" - Closes the assistant

## Future Improvements

As I continue learning Python, I plan to add:
- Weather API integration
- Email functionality
- Calendar integration
- Multiple language support
- Custom command handling
- Voice activity detection
